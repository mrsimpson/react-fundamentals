# Yet another Github Battle

While working through the awesome [React funcamentals course](https://tylermcginnis.com/courses/react-fundamentals) by the no-lesser @tylermcginnis, I figured I wanted to adapt some aspects. This repo contains a Github battle which features the following "enhancements":

## Functional changes

- Username validation of battle opponents
- Paged, parallel fetching all of a user's repositories (not limited to `size=100`)

## Technical changes

- ES6 (particularly decomposition, async/await, named imports)
- Webpack config to support `.jsx`
- Airbnb linting configuration - and satisfy it

## On the list

- Use SASS/LESS
- maybe use a Flexbox based simple CSS framework, e. g. [bulma](https://github.com/jgthms/bulma)
